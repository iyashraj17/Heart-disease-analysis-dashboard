# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard



## 📌 Overview
This project provides an interactive **Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard** built with **Power BI**.  
It visualizes patient data, survival rates, and critical health indicators, enabling **data-driven insights into heart disease trends**.  

The data underwent **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL** and **data cleaning in Python**, ensuring high-quality and reliable insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** for accurate visualizations.
- Conduct **EDA in SQL** to uncover trends and anomalies in the dataset.
- Analyze survival rates across different **age and gender groups**.
- Explore the **impact of risk factors** like **Smoking, High BP, Diabetes, and Anaemia**.
- Build an **interactive dashboard** with dynamic gender-based filtering.

---

## 🧪 EDA & Data Preparation
### **1️⃣ SQL - Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Identified **null values** and **inconsistent data types**.
- Analyzed **distribution of survival status** by age and gender.
- Generated **aggregations** for average serum creatinine and ejection fraction levels.

### **2️⃣ Python - Data Cleaning**
- Used **Pandas** for:
  - Handling missing and duplicate records.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Normalizing date and numeric fields.
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for basic visual verification.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Key Metrics:** Survival Rate, Total Survivals, Total Deaths, Average Age of Survival.
- **Age-Based Analysis:** Bar and line visuals showing survival counts and serum creatinine trends.
- **Interactive Gender Buttons:** Toggle between **Male** and **Female** to dynamically update visuals.
- **Risk Factor Insights:** Impact of Smoking, High BP, Anaemia, and Diabetes by age group.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, minimalistic theme with custom icons and color palette.
